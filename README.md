## Sobel Filter

I want to learn computer vision, and this is the first step! The goal of this project is to create a program that can load a PPM image, apply a sobel filter, and write it to a PPM file. 

### Goals
- Make core functionality (See above.) work
- Design a GUI interface to make UX more seamless
